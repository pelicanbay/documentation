Pelican Bay is a Cfx.re community that focuses on delivering an immersive and creative experience to all of its players. Our goal is to create an economy server that outshines the competition in terms of roleplaying, with a variety of features that make it easy to do what **you** want.

If you're a new player, we recommend that you brush over **all** of the topics within the documentation to ensure that you understand the way that our server operates and what is required of you. (Especially when setting yourself up to use our CAD system)
