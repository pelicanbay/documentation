## Registering Vehicles

Vehicles that are purchased in-game are automatically registered to your SonoranCAD character, however you **will** have to manually update the following records when you purchase the vehicle:

- Make
- Model
- Color
- Year

This is because there is currently no way to get this information over to the SonoranCAD system.

!!!primary Notice
Your license plate will still tie back to your character either way, but the vehicle description will not be accurate until it is set by you.
