## Registering Licences

You **will** have to manually update the status of your licences on the SonoranCAD system when the in-game status changes as there is currently no way for us to check if they are valid through the Sonoran API. We will look into implementing this in the future.

If you do not want to constantly update your records yourself, then find an officer and they will change it for you, as long as you have a valid in-game licence that verifies this. This also goes for traffic stops, however you should disclose this information as soon as they make initial contact with you.
