## Registering Characters

You **do not** have to manually register characters within SonoranCAD. Once you have created your character in-game, it will automatically sync the data between the two systems. To assign your in-game character to your SonoranCAD account, in order to further edit what Law Enforcement Officers can see, you can do the following:

Navigate to the `pelican` community on SonoranCAD and access the `Civilian` module:

Press on the `New Character` button at the top of the page:

And search for your character
![](/static/images/cad/searchcharacter.png)
This will then sync your in-game character to your SonoranCAD account and allow you to view their data and modify their qualities. Certain qualities will link back into the game and some will not.
